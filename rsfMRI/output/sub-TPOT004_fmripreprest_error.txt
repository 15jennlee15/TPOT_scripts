The ``--output_space`` option has been deprecated in version 1.4.0. Your selection of spaces "T1w, template, fsaverage, fsnative" will be inserted at the front of the ``--output-spaces`` argument list. Please update your scripts to use ``--output-spaces``.
Option "--use-aroma" requires functional images to be resampled to MNI152NLin6Asym space. The argument "MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2" has been automatically added to the list of output spaces (option ``--output-spaces``).
